Append ?raw=true to any file URL on Github to get the direct link.

After the file has been uploaded to Github, click the filename in the list and you’ll get the file’s URL in the browser’s address. Append *?raw=true* to the URL and you get a downloadable / embeddable version.

For instance, if the file URL is *github.com/labnol/files/hello.pdf*, 

the direct link to the same file would be 

*github.com/labnol/files/hello.pdf?raw=true*. 

If the uploaded file is an image, you can even embed it in your website using the standard img tag.
